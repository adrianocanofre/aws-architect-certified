ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.  

ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:  
* Redis
* Memcache
