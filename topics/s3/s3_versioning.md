# Versioning  



### Tips  

* Stores all version of an object(including all writes and even if you delete an object);  
* Great Backup tools;
* Once enable, Versioning cannot be disable, only suspended;  
* Integrates with Lifecycle rules;  
* Versioning's MFA Delete Capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security;
