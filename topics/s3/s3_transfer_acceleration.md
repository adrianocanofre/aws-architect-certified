# Transfer acceleration  

**What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?**
S3 Transfer Acceleration utilises the cloudFront Edge Network to accelerate your upload to S3. Instead of uploading directly to your S3 bucket,  you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to S3. You will get a distinct URL to upload to;  

For your bucket to work with transfer acceleration, the bucket name must conform to DNS naming requirements and must not contain periods (".").
