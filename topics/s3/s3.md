# S3  

S3 providers developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.  

**What is S3?**  

* S3 is a safe place to store your files;  
* It is Object-based storage;  
* The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities;  

**S3 - Basic**  

* S3 is Object-storage;  
* Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB;
* There is unlimited storage;  
* Files are stored in Buckets(Buckets are folder inside the cloud);  
* With a PUT, you can upload objects, up to 5GB;  
* Using the multipart upload API, you can upload large objects, up to 5TB;  
* 3.500 PUT per second;  
* 5.500 GET requests per second;  
* S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally;  
* When you upload a file to S3, you will receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful;  
* Read after write consistency for PUTS of new Objects;  
* Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETS(can take some time to propagate);  
* S3 is A Simple Key-value Store;  
  * Key = This is simply the name of the object;  
  * Value = This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes;  
  * Version ID = Important for versioning;  
  * Metadata = Data about data you are storing;  
  * Subresources:  
    * ACL = Access Control Lists;  
    * torrent;

### Storage Tiers/Classes  

**S3 Standard**  
99,99% availability, 99,9999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.  

**S3 IA(Infrequently Access)**  

For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee that S3, but you are charged  a retrieval fee.  

**S3 One Zone - IA**  

Want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple **Availability Zone** data resilience.

**S3 Intelligent Tiering**.

Designed to optimize cost by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead(machine learning).  

**Glacier**  

Glacier is a secure durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data at cost that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.  

**Glacier Deep Archive**  

Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3's lowest-cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

### S3 Charger  

**Charges for...**  

* Storage;  
* Requests;  
* Storage Management Pricing;  
* Data Transfer Pricing;  
* Transfer Acceleration:  
  * Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and S3 Bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloduFront's globally distributed **edge location**.
