# VPC Flow Logs  

VPC Flow logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data is stored using Amazon CloudWatch logs. After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch logs.
