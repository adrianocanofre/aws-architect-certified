# Roles EC2  


* Roles are more secure than storing your access key and secret access key on individual EC2 instances;  
* Roles are easier to manage;  
* Roles are universal - you can use them in any region;  
* Roles can be assigned to an EC2 instance after it is created using both the console & command line;
