# Security Group  

A security group(sg) acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. When you launch an instance, you can specify one or more sg; otherwise, we use the default sg.  You can modify the rules for a sg at any time, new rules are automatically applied to all instances  that are associated with the sg.

The rules of a sg control the inbound that's allowed to reach the instances that are associated with the sg and the outbound traffic that's allowed to leave them.
