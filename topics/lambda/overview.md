# Lambda  

Lambda is a compute service where  you can upload your code and create a lambda function. AWS lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code. You don't have to worry about Operating Systems, patching, scaling, etc.  

**You can use lambda in the following ways**  

* As a event-driven compute service where AWS Lambda runs your code in response to events. These events cloud be changes to data in Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table;  

* As a compute service to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway or APISs calls made using AWS SDKs.
