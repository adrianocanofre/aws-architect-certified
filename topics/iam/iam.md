What ahve we learned so far?

IAM is universal. It does not apply to regions at this time.

The "root account" is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account. It has complete Admin access.  

New Users have NO permissions when first created.  

New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created.  

These are not the same as a password. You cannot use the Access Key ID & Secret Access Key to login in to the console.  

You only get to view these once. If you lose them , you have regenerate them.  

Always setup MFA on your root account.  

You can create and customise your own password rotation policies.
